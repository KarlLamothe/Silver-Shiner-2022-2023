Monitoring imperilled species provides critical information for decision-making, but the effort needed to detect significant changes in the occurrence of rare species often requires substantial resources. To address this challenge, we developed a sampling design that reduced the effort needed to detect proportional reductions in Silver Shiner (Notropis photogenis) occupancy probability (ψ) over time, a species listed as Threatened in Canada owing to its rarity and threats from urbanization and agriculture. A stratified random site selection approach based on the probabilistic relationship between site depth and adult Silver Shiner ψ was implemented in the fall of 2022 and 2023. Stratified sampling increased estimated ψ by 72% in 2022 compared to previous non-stratified designs, with similar detection probabilities (p ~ 0.8), boosting power to detect future declines by 86.5%. However, a significant reduction in p between 2022 and 2023 negated these gains and prevented conclusions of within-river range contraction. These findings demonstrate the potential to improve the power of occupancy models with habitat-focused sampling designs and provide considerations around sample size when designing occupancy-based monitoring programs.
