Monitoring imperilled species provides critical information for decision-making, but the effort needed to detect significant changes in occurrence or abundance of these imperfectly detected, rare species often requires more resources than available. The objective here was to implement a sampling design that reduces the effort needed to detect proportional reductions in adult Silver Shiner (Notropis photogenis) occupancy probability (ψ) over time, a species listed as Threatened in Canada owing to its rarity and threats from urbanization and agriculture. A stratified random site selection approach based on the probabilistic relationship between site depth and adult Silver Shiner ψ was implemented in fall 2022 and 2023. Stratified sampling increased estimated ψ by 77% in 2022 compared to previous non-stratified methods, with similar detection probabilities (p ~ 0.8), boosting power to detect future declines by 86.5%. However, a significant reduction in p between 2022 and 2023 negated these gains and prevented conclusions of within-river range contraction. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding detection processes and provides considerations around sample size and baseline estimates when designing monitoring programs.
